<p>Designed by Thomas Harrison in the Classical style, this was a replacement for the old exchange and is at the junction of Market Street and Exchange Street. It was constructed in Runcorn stone. The cost, £20,000, was paid for in advance by 400 members who bought £50 shares and paid £30 each to buy the site. It was badly damaged in the 1996 bombing, but has since been restored.</p>
