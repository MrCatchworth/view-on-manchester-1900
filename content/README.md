# View on Manchester 1900

A browser-based historical educational webapp, allowing users to browse a variety of information about Manchester in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

The webapp loads information on map markers from a JSON file, and is designed so as to support various types of media and textual information. A marker becomes "active" when clicked, at which point its media/text is shown on a sidebar.

This is a collaborative project with Gill Rossini (@rainbowhistory), who is the real brains behind this. She has kindly provided a great number of scanned postcards from that era, complete with a blurb for each, and many links from which I can find more material.
