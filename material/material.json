It was originally planned to place the monument in front of the Royal Infirmary building at Piccadilly, between the statues of Wellington and Peel. However it was felt that its ornate Gothic design was not in keeping with the neoclassical infirmary. In 1863, land was offered by the Corporation which was cleared to make way for a public space. In 1868, building work for the Gothic style town hall was begun, and is to the rear of the Albert memorial which is in the centre of this image."
